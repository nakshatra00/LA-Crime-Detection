# LA-Crime-Detection

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting crime categories based on various features related to crime incidents. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify crime types, which could be valuable for law enforcement and urban planning.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information about crime incidents, such as:
- Location details (Latitude, Longitude, Area)
- Temporal information (Date Reported, Date Occurred)
- Victim information (Age, Sex, Descent)
- Crime details (Modus Operandi, Premise, Weapon Used)

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Imputed missing latitude and longitude with mean values
   - Created binary features for cross-street presence and victim presence
   - Filled missing categorical values with most frequent occurrences

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created 'Days_Lapsed' feature to capture time between occurrence and reporting
   - Transformed 'Modus_Operandi' using Multi-Label Binarization

3. **Categorical Encoding**:
   - Used One-Hot Encoding for categorical features

## Model Development
Three models were evaluated:
1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest Classifier

The Random Forest Classifier performed best with the following parameters:
- n_estimators: 300
- min_samples_split: 2
- min_samples_leaf: 1
- max_depth: None
- bootstrap: False

## Results
- Random Forest Classifier achieved 94.08% accuracy on the validation set

## Future Improvements
- Explore more advanced feature engineering techniques
- Investigate other algorithms like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks
- Perform more in-depth error analysis to understand misclassifications

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
